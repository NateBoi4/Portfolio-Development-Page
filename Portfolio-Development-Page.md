## Summary

[- The portfolio evaluated](https://mattfiler.co.uk/)
This is a portfolio page for Matt Filer, a Unity engineer at Ultraleap.

## Strength
Matt's presentation of content is a great strength.
Matt ultilizes a strong comination of short, breif text mixed with associating imagery and videos to allow for quick looks into his personal projects.
Matt makes use of several buttons to hide extra descriptions for content so as not to flood his page with words.
Matt provides several useful and relevant links to help give the reader further insight into his background and character.

## Improvements
One suggestion for improvement is to stop making use of small videos. Even though these videos can be maximized rather easily, it might be more intuitive to have this video go to fullscreen or hyperlink to a new tab when access.
Small video frames will almost never be fully viewed in the smaller frame space.
Another possible improvement would be to use multiple pages to better organize his spilt presentation of games, software, mods, websites, and videos.
One question I would ask Matt would be, "Why have a section dedicated to videos, when most previous sections already have video link?"

## Best fit
I would hire Matt because he gives the impression that he has relevant experience in his area of expertise and he does a good job of transferring his knowledge and strengths through his webpage.
I would hire Matt as a software or game developer.
Game Programmer
I believe that Matt would have an easy time interacting with others, as he seems quite active on his social media profiles that he has provided links to.

## General considerations
I think Matt has clearly articulated his strengths as a game programmer, but he has not quite showcased his ability to work on a team.
